  "summary": "Partial week so far (Mon–Thu), but the momentum from last week is holding. The new video \"I Built an AI Dashboard in One Day\" launched Monday and immediately picked up traction — 4,120 views on day one with a 7.2% CTR, your best launch yet. YouTube subscriber growth hit 33 in a single day (Monday), nearly matching what used to take a full week.\n\nThe cross-platform play is working. LinkedIn is on pace for its best week ever — the \"building in public\" thread about the dashboard got 134 comments on Monday alone. Instagram engagement remains elevated at 8.1%.\n\nNewsletter sent Tuesday pulled a 51.2% open rate — your best since November. The combination of timely content (referencing the dashboard video) and the growing YouTube-to-newsletter funnel is clearly working.",
