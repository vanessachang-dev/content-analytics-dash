  "summary": "This was a breakout week driven almost entirely by one YouTube video. \"5 Claude Features Most People Don't Know About\" hit the algorithm sweet spot — 65% of the week's YouTube views came from that single video, and it's still climbing. The ripple effect was real: LinkedIn saw a 34% jump in impressions as you cross-posted clips, and Instagram engagement rate hit 7.9%, the highest in 90 days.\n\nNewsletter performance was solid — the Tuesday send pulled a 48.2% open rate and 6.7% click rate, both above your trailing averages. Subject line \"The AI features hiding in plain sight\" clearly resonated with the YouTube audience crossover.\n\nTikTok continues its steady climb. The short-form clips from the Claude video drove 2,341 views on Saturday alone. You're building real momentum on that platform — follower growth was 8x what it was in December.",
